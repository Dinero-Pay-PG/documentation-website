# Subscription

We provide the option to schedule your payments so that the amount will be deducted automatically without the customer's intervention by adding a schedule id to the transaction.<br></br>

## Enabling Subscription

You have two methods to implement scheduling.

### 1- Managed by Your System

To have control over the scheduling process and trigger it from your system, you can modify it in the [Authentication](../../api/gateway/authentication-request) request, `recurring_init = true` to indicate that this is a scheduled transaction. <br></br>

If the customer approves the subscription plan, in the response, you will receive `recurring_init_trans_id` and `recurring_token`, which you need to store in your system to make recurring requests using them in the future.

### Creating Recurring Transaction

If you have the `recurring_init_trans_id` and `recurring_token` stored on your system, you can send a request to [/api/v1/payment/re—Åurring](../../api/gateway/charge-token), if the transaction is successful, the amount will be deducted from the customer without the need for his presence.

### Sample Request To Indicate a Subscription Transaction

```json
{
	"merchant_key": "1d903dfda0-e8dc-11ed-bbba-d60edfb1bd8d8",
	"operation": "purchase",

	"order": {
		"number": "order-1234",

	},
	"recurring_init": true,

```

### 2- Managed By The Payment Gateway

To ease your transactions, you can let the scheduling be handled by us, the process will be similar to the previous method. However, this time there is no need for your system to schedule the recurring transaction it will be maintained by us; you will receive notification calls for each payment.<br></br>

First you will need to create a schedule object , there are two ways to create it .

### Dashboard

Once you log in to the dashboard, on the left sidebar, you will see **Schedules**, click on that, and it will navigate you to the Recurring Schedules page; on the top left corner, you will see a plus button, click on it to create a `schedule` object.

### API

You can create a `schedule` object using the API by sending a request to [https://api.dineropay.com/post/](../../api/gateway/schedule-id).<br></br>

:::note
This request should have the content type as `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
:::

### Example Request To Create a Schedule Id

```

https://api.dineropay.com/post?action="CREATE_SCHEDULE",&"client_key"="1dfeda0-e8dc-11ed-hhba-d60e6b1bd8d8",&"name"="for testing scheduled  payment through api",&"inverval_length"="1",&"interval_unit"="day",&"payment_count"="3",&"hash"="0D6F1971358364EEFE3E3A31928A37F8"&}=

```

## Create a Recurring Payment

Now that you have the schedule id, you can use it in future requests to indicate that this transaction should be scheduled and handled by us in case you provide the `schedule_id`; otherwise, it will be handled by your system. <br></br>

In the request body, add the parameters `recurring_init = true` and `schedule_id = xxxxx-xxx` in case you want the scheduling to be handled by the gateway.<br></br>

Refer to the [Payment](../../Payments/Purchase/create_payment) section for more details.

:::note

The schedule object can be used in more than one transaction.

Keep in mind to count the first initial transaction for the recurring payments.
