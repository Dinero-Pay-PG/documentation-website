# Subscription

We provide you with the option to schedule your payments , so that the amount will be dedcuted automatically without the customer intervention , by creating a schedule id and with other transaction.<br></br>

## Enabling Subscription

you have two way to enable via the API or the dashbaord ,

### dashbaord

once you login to the dashbaord , on the left sidebar you will see **Schedules** click on that and you will navigate it to the Recurring Schedules page , on the top left corner you will see a plus button click on it to create a `schedule` object.

### API

you can create a `schedule` object using the API by sending a request to [https://api.dineropay.com/post/](../../api/gateway/schedule-id)<br></br>

:::note
this request should have the content type as `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`
:::

### example request

```
https://api.rafinita.com/post?action="CREATE_SCHEDULE",&"client_key"="1dfeda0-e8dc-11ed-hhba-d60e6b1bd8d8",&"name"="for testing schduled payment through api",&"inverval_length"="1",&"interval_unit"="day",&"payment_count"="3",&"hash"="0D6F1971358364EEFE3E3A31928A37F8"&}=
```

## Create a recurring payment

now that you have the scheudle id you can use in your future requests to indicate that this transaction should be schduled <br></br>
