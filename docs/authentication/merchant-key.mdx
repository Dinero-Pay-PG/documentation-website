# Merchant Key üóù

Authenticate your account using the API by including your `merchant key` in the request body. <br></br>
You can get your merchant key from the Dashboard. Your merchant key carries many privileges. So, be sure to keep it secret!<br></br>

## Passwrod

Alongside providing the `merchant_key` in the request body, you will require access to the `password`. <br></br>
You can get the password from the _Dashboard_. **This password is essential to create a hash that will ensure the integrity of the request.** <br></br>

:::note
The checkout service validates the request parameters and sends the error response in case of invalid data detection.<br></br>
Go to the [Hash Validation](./hash-validation) section for more info on how the hash should be generated.
