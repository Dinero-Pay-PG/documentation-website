## Fields on the checkout page

In the checkout page there will be some fields based on the acquirer requirements <br></br>
however your customer will not see fields that the bank dose not need <br></br>
For example, if an alternative payment method is specified such as `stcpay`, the card data is not displayed on the Checkout page.

As well, pay attention to the conditional fields such as e-mail or billing address. If the e-mail and billing address (data object) parameters are specified in the request, the Checkout page will not contain them.

Additional fields can also be displayed if a payment method is selected that requests additional data from the Customer.

The Checkout page has the fields validation. In case of the invalid data the error message will be shown and the field will be highlighted.
