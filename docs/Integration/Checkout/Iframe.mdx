# iFrame

iFrame is a powerful tool for integrating our payment interface into your website/app. It allows you to embed external web content, such as the payment gateway's interface, seamlessly within your website/app.
With iFrame, you can provide your customers with a secure and a convenient payment experience directly on your website/app. By integrating the payment gateway with the iFrame, you maintain control over the overall user interface and design while still leveraging the advanced functionality and security features of the payment gateway.

## Implementing iFrame

All you need is to pass in the code the `redirect_url` received in the response from the authentication request.<br></br>
To know how you can get the `Redirect_url` check the [API Section](../../../api/gateway/authentication-request)

### example

```html
<iframe src="redirect_url" height="600" width="300"></iframe>
```

### 3D authentication

> - Your customer might get redirected for authentication against the 3D Secure system of his card issuer's bank.

### Receiving response

> - After the payment is processed, the customer will be taken to the `success_url` or `cancel_url` specified on the request object, depending on the results.
>   Also, you will be notified through the `callback_notification` if it's configured in the dashboard.

:::note
Based on the regulations here in Saudi Arabia, most of the transactions require 3D authentication.
