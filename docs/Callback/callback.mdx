# Callback notification

Callback notification is the main way to receive updates regarding the payment status , so it's critical to make sure that you are implementing that correctly in your applicatoin .<br></br>
This service allows you to subscribe to events happening in the _payment_ life cycle
We will notify in case of an event occured.

## Usage

In order to use the the callback and receive notification you will to have to setup the notification_url <br></br>

> - You can set it up from the dashboard by clicking on _your avatar icon_ on the right corner.

## Delivery protocol

When the system send an event to your server , your system should replay with a `status_code= 200` <br></br>
In case if it's not successfully delivered the system will make up to _3_ additional attempts<br></br>
between each attempt the interval will increase <br></br>
no further delivery attempts will be made if the callback is not successfully delivered , however you can resend it manually from the dashabord make sure to update the notification_url as well .

:::note
Please note that due to the asynchronous nature of network requests, it is possible for a callback delivery confirmation (HTTP response with a 200 series status code) to not properly arrive from the callback's target server. Therefore it is possible in case of severe network faults for the target server to receive a callback, respond to it with a 200 series HTTP status code and then receive the same callback after an interval.

## Events

we will send you a notification when a certain event/operation occured in the payment life cycle .

> you can choose what type of events to listen for by choosing them from the dasbhoard .
