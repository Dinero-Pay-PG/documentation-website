# Callback notification

Callback notification is the primary way to receive updates regarding the payment status, so you must implement that correctly in your application.<br></br>
This service allows you to receive a notification in case of an event has occurred in the _payment_ life cycle.

## Usage

To use the callback and receive notifications, you must set up the `notification_url`. <br></br>

> - You can set it up from the dashboard by clicking on _your avatar icon_ in the right corner.

## Delivery protocol

When the system send an event to your server , your system should replay with a `status_code= 200`. <br></br>
If it's not successfully delivered, the system will make up to **three** additional attempts between each attempt, there will be an increased interval, and no further delivery attempts will be made if the callback is not successfully delivered. However, you can resend it manually from the dashboard, but you must update the `notification_url` as well.

:::note
Please note that due to the asynchronous nature of network requests, it is possible for a callback delivery confirmation (HTTP response with a 200 series status code) to not properly arrive from the callback's target server. Therefore it is possible in case of severe network faults for the target server to receive a callback, respond to it with a 200 series HTTP status code, and then receive the same callback after an interval.

## Events

We will send you a notification when some events/operations Occur in the payment life cycle.

> you can choose what type of events to listen for by choosing them from the dasbhoard .

> The payment is unsuccessful if the transaction has `status = success` and `type = redirect`.
