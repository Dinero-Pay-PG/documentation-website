# Create a Payment

## Purchase

To create a payment that will let the customer pay using credit card , debit card _(mada,etc...)_ , applepay, stcpay, <br></br>
or any saved card or authorized transaction, you will be making a purchase ( Authentication request ) to [`/api/v1/session/`](../../api/gateway/authentication-request) <br></br>

## Requirement to create a purchase reqeust ( Authentication request )

> You must sign up for a test account [here](https://dashboard.dineropay.com/login?continue=%2F) <br></br>
> Follow the steps [here](../../get-started#making-your-first-payment-as-easy-as-following-the-below-steps)

Getting your merchant key and your password makes you ready to create an online transaction <br></br>
Both can be found in the <circle width ='260' text='merchant dashboard'/>

## Make payments

To run payments in your application use <u>[`POST /api/v1/sessions/`](../../../api/gateway/authentication-request)</u> , request to register payments and receive the redirect_url (`redirec_url`). After the payment is processed, gateway will redirect the client back to your website (take note of `success_url`, `cancel_curl`).

## Tokenization

You can save the customer's card data so that they can reuse it for future payments.<br></br>
in the `callback_notification` you receive the card token to be used for future payment.
to learn more about **tokenization** check [_saving the card_](../../saving-cards)

## Check the payment status

You have three options to check payment status

> 1. Use `success_url` pramater of [`Authentication`](../../../api/gateway/authentication-request) request object
> 2. Use `GET` `/api/v1/payment/status` request
> 3. Set up a `callback_url` in the dashboard to listen for events.
