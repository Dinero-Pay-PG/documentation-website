# Create a Payment

## Purchase

To create a payment that will let the customer pay using a credit card, debit card Mada, applePay, stcPay, etc..., <br></br>
or any saved card or authorized transaction, you will be making a purchase (Authentication request ) to [`/api/v1/session/`](../../api/gateway/authentication-request). <br></br>

## The requirement to create a purchase request ( Authentication request )

> You must sign up for a test account [here](https://dashboard.dineropay.com/login?continue=%2F). <br></br>
> Follow the steps [here](../../get-started#making-your-first-payment-as-easy-as-following-the-below-steps).

Getting your merchant key and your password makes you ready to create an online transaction. <br></br>
Both can be found in the <circle width ='260' text='merchant dashboard'/>

## Make payments

To run payments in your application use <u>[`POST /api/v1/sessions/`](../../../api/gateway/authentication-request)</u> request to register payments and receive the `redirect_url`. After the payment is processed, the gateway will redirect the client back to your website (take note of the `success_url`, `cancel_url`).

## Tokenization

You can save the customer's card data so that they can reuse it for future payments.<br></br>
In the `callback_notification`, you will receive the card token used for future payments.
To learn more about **tokenization**, check [_saving the card_](../../saving-cards).

## Check the payment status

You have three options to check payment status:

> 1. Use the `success_url` pramater of the [`Authentication`](../../../api/gateway/authentication-request) request object.
> 2. Use the `GET` `/api/v1/payment/status` request.
> 3. Set up a `callback_url` in the dashboard to listen for events.
