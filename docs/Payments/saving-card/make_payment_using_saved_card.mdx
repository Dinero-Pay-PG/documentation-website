# Make a payment with a saved card

## Payment request with a token

If you have saved the token from a previous request, you can use it to make an [Authentication](../../api/gateway/authentication-request) request (payment request), and you will see anonymized card details on the payment form, which will substantially simplify the payment process.

### Sample request

```json
{
	"merchant_key": "1c568e26-c997-11e9-8be4-0242ac12000f",
	"operation": "purchase",
	"order": {
		"number": "{{order_number}}",
		"amount": "{{order_amount}}",
		"currency": "{{order_currency}}",
		"description": "{{order_description}}"
	},
	"cancel_url": "https://example.com/cancel",
	"success_url": "https://example.com/success",
	"card_token": ["f5d6a0ab6fcfb6487a39e2256e50fff3c95aaa97075ee5e539bb662fceff4dc1"],
	"hash": "{{session_hash}}"
}
```

:::note
If the `card_token` is specified, `req_token` will be ignored, as the card is already saved.
