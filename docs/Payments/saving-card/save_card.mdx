# Saving customer card details

## Card data tokenization

For regular customers, we have made the payment page even more convenient and simpler.

You can save customers' card data so that they can reuse it for future payments.

> To do this, you need to send the `req_token = true` parameter in the [Authentication](../../api/gateway/authentication-request) request.
> And then, in the `callback_notification`, you will receive a card token.

### Sample request

```json
{
	"merchant_key": "1d903ea0-e8dc-11ed-bbba-d60e6b1bd8d8",
	"operation": "purchase",
	"req_token": true,
	"methods": ["card"],
	"order": {
		"number": "order-1234",
		"amount": "1.00",
		"currency": "SAR",
		"description": "gift"
	},
	"cancel_url": "https://example.com/cancel",
	"success_url": "https://example.com/success",
	"hash": "416830ec3be6ac7c6ca539a4e9dbdd5c8971097d"
}
```

Note that we add the `req_token` parameter in the request to indicate that we wish to save the customer's card.
By defaut the value of `req_token` will be `false`
