# Refund

## Making a refund

> - To make a refund, you will have to make a `POST /api/v1/payment/refund`. <br></br>

You will need to send the `payment_id` in the request, so make sure to save it once you receive the `notification_callback`.

---

## Sample request

```json
{
	"merchant_key": "xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx",
	"payment_id": "63c781cc-de3d-11eb-a1f1-0242ac130006",
	"amount": "0.19",
	"hash": "{{operation_hash}}"
}
```

:::note

- The optional `amount` argument can be included in the request body to request a partial refund.
- If it's not passed by default, it will refund the full amount.
- If the transaction was successful, the response status should be `refunded`.
