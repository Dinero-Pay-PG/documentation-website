# Refund

## Making a refund

> - To make a refund you will have to make a <u>[`POST /api/v1/payment/refund`](../../../api/gateway/purchases-refund)</u> <br></br>

you will need to send the `payment_id` in the request so make sure to save it once you receive the `notification_callback`.

---

## sample request

```json
{
	"merchant_key": "xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx",
	"payment_id": "63c781cc-de3d-11eb-a1f1-0242ac130006",
	"amount": "0.19",
	"hash": "{{operation_hash}}"
}
```

:::note

- Optional `amount` argument can be included in the request body to request a partial refund.
- If it's not passed by default it will refund the full amount
- If the transaction was success in the response the status should be `refunded`
