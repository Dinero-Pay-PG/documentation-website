# Get the payment details

To get the payment status, you will make a <u>[`GET /api/v1/payment/status`](../../../api/gateway/check-transaction-status)</u>. <br></br>
You will retrieve the payment status and if it's declined, you will receive the reason.

---

## Types of payment status

The payment status is a way for the gateway to tell you what state your transaction is in, and based on that, you should take the appropriate action.

By default, you will receive a `callback_notification`, but in case you want to make a follow-up request to check for the payment status, you can make a <u>[`GET /api/v1/payment/status`](../../../api/gateway/check-transaction-status)</u>.

# Status

Payment status will be one of these

- prepare
- settled
- pending
- 3ds
- redirect
- decline
- refund
- reversal
- chargeback

> If the transaction is unsuccessful, you should `receive` a reason parameter in the response.

## Sample request

To check the payment status, you will need to provide the `payment_id`, so make sure to save it once you receive it from the `callback_notification`.

```json
{
  "merchant_key": " xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx",
  "payment_id": "dc66cdd8-d702-11ea-9a2f-0242c0a87002",
  "hash": "xxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

  "payment_id": "24f7401c-fc47-11ec-8d07-0242ac120015",
