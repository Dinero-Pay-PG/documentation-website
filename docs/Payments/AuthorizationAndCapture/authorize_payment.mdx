# Authorize a payment

By default, all transactions are authorized and captured immediately, and the amount will be deducted from the customer account. However, sometimes you may want to hold the amount for a while before deciding to capture it.

## Enabling Authorization

To enable authorization, you will need to contact us to enable it for you.

You will specify the duration for which the amount should be held before it is captured. For example, if you want the amount to be held for five days before it is captured. Once we have configured that, subsequent requests will hold the amount for the duration you specified, then capture it.

## Release the amount

In case you don't want to capture the amount any longer, you can go to the dashboard and release the amount before it's captured.
