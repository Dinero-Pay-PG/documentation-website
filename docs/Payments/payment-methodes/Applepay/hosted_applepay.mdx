# Hosted applepay

By default, **applePay** will be enabled once you go live. We refer to this as the hosted method, it will save you time and there is no need for any additional configuration, as it is handled by the gateway.<br></br>

It will be shown in the checkout page <highlight color = 'grey'><u> only if it's opened through Safari Browser</u></highlight> <br></br>

:::note

At the moment we only support hosted applePay which doesn't require any configuration from your side .<br></br>

once your account is in live mode appleay should appear as a payment option in the checkout page.
