# Applepay

By default, **applePay** will be enabled once you go live. We refer to this as the hosted method; it will save you time and there is no need for any additional configuration, as it is handled by the gateway.<br></br>

It will be shown in the checkout page <highlight color = 'grey'><u> only if it's opened through Safari Browser</u></highlight> <br></br>

:::note

At the moment we only support hosted applePay which dosent require any configuration from your side .<br></br>
