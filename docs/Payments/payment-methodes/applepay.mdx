# Applepay

By default **applepay** will be enabled once you go live, we refer to this by the hosted method, it will save you time and no need for any additional configuration as all of it handled by the gateway.<br></br>

it will be shown in the checkout page <highlight color = 'grey'><u> only if it's opened through Safari Browser</u></highlight> <br></br>

:::note

At the moment we only support hosted applepay which dosent require any configuration from your side .<br></br>

<u>Once we add the direct applepay we will update the docs</u>
